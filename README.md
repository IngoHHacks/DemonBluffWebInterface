# Demon Bluff Web Interface
This repository contains the web interface for the Demon Bluff Solver/Helper/Visualizer/etc. The web interface is built in Godot Engine and exported to HTML5 with WebAssembly (WASM).

## Projects
`StateExporter` is a MelonLoader mod that exports the game state to the clipboard. This can be pasted into the web interface importer to load the village state for visualization and solving.  
The exporter only exports known information. Characters that are not revealed show up as unknown and characters that bluff will show up as their bluff (unless executed).  
A compiled version of the mod can be found in Releases

`WebInterface` is the Godot project that contains the web interface. It can be exported to HTML5 with WebAssembly (WASM) for use in a web browser.
The current production version is hosted at https://ingoh.net/dbwi

## Features (Web Interface)
- Visualize Demon Bluff villages
- Solve Demon Bluff villages
- Import and export village states
- Add extra information (e.g. known bluffs, known roles, markers, etc.) to the village state

## Important Note
I am totally the best player of Demon Bluff ever and this tool is just to help you be as good as me lol :]  
Prove it? Okay:
- I have over 300 confirmed saved villages on Endless Mode.
- I once solved a village in under 5 minutes without any hints or tools.
- I have every single achievement in the game.
- I never lost a ranked match in Demon Bluff (Ranked matches aren't a thing because it's a singleplayer game, but if they were, I wouldn't lose).
- All my friends are jealous of my Demon Bluff skills (They don't say so, but I can tell).
- I am the reigning champion of my local Demon Bluff tournament (I made it up, but it sounds impressive).
- Rumor has it that the developers of Demon Bluff consulted me for game balance and design (Rumor has it).
- I once solved a village by accident by just clicking randomly (It's not luck, it's skill).
- Enough said.
